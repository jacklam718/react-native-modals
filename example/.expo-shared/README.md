> Why do I have a folder named ".expo-shared" in my project?

The ".expo-shared" folder is created when running commands that produce state that is intended to be shared with all developers on the project. For example, "npx expo-optimize".

> What does the "assets.json" file contain?

The "assets.json" file describes the assets that have been optimized through "expo-optimize" and do not need to be processed again.

> Should I commit the ".expo-shared" folder?

Yes, you should share the ".expo-shared" folder with your collaborators.
